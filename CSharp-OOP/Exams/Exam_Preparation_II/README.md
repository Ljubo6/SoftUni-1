# OOP Basics Exam â€“ SoftUniRestaurant

### Overview

As we all love food, today you were chosen to build a simple restaurant system. This system must have support for **food** , **drinks** and **tables** in the restaurant. The project will consist of **model classes** and a **controller class** , which manages the **interaction** between the **food** , **drinks** and **tables**.

### Setup

Open the provided skeleton. Don&#39;t change the given namespaces. **Not following this rule will lead to your code not compiling in the Judge system**.

**Name your fields and properties**  **exactly**  **how they are given in this document.**

# Task 1: Structure (50 points)

You are given **3** interfaces, which you have to implement **by yourself** and then implement their functionality in the **correct classes**.

There are **3** types of entities in the application: **Tables** , **Food** and **Drinks** :

### Food

The **Food** is a **base class** for any **type of food** and it **should not be able to be instantiated**.

#### Data

- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Name **â€“** string (If the name is null or whitespace throw an ArgumentException with message ****&quot; ****Name cannot be null or white space!****&quot;)**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** ServingSize **â€“** int (can&#39;t be less or equal to 0. In these cases, throw an ArgumentException with message &quot; ****Serving size cannot be less or equal to zero****&quot;)**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Price **â€“** decimal (can&#39;t be less or equal to 0. In these cases, throw an ArgumentException with message &quot; ****Price cannot be less or equal to zero!&quot;**** )**

#### Behavior

##### string ToString()

Returns a **string** with information about **each food**. The returned string must be in the following format:

**&quot;{current food name}: {current serving size}g - {current price - formatted to the second digit}&quot;**

#### Constructor

A **food** should take the following values upon initialization:

string name, int servingSize, decimal price

#### Child Classes

There are several concrete types of **food** :

- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Dessert â€“ **with constant value for** InitialServingSize - 200**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Salad - **with constant value for** InitialServingSize - 300**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Soup - **with constant value for** InitialServingSize - 245**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** MainCourse - **with constant value for** InitialServingSize - 500**

### Drink

The **Drink** is a **base class** for any **type of drink** and it **should not be able to be instantiated**.

#### Data

- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Name **â€“** string (If the name is null or whitespace throw an ArgumenException with message ****&quot; ****Name cannot be null or white space!****&quot;****)**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** ServingSize **â€“** int (if the serving size is less than or equal to 0, throw an ArgumentException with message &quot; ****Serving size cannot be less or equal to zero****&quot;)**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Price **â€“** decimal (if the price is less than or equal to 0, throw an ArgumentException with message &quot; ****Price cannot be less or equal to zero****&quot;)**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Brand -  ****string (If the brand is null or whitespace thrown ArgumentException with message**  **&quot;**** Brand cannot be null or white space! ****&quot;**** )**

#### Behavior

##### string ToString()

Returns a **string** with information about **each drink**. The returned string must be in the following format:

**&quot;{current drink name} {current brand name} - {current serving size}ml - {current price - formatted to the second digit}lv&quot;**

#### Constructor

A **drink** should take the following values upon initialization:

string name, int servingSize, decimal price, string brand

#### Child Classes

There are several concrete types of **drink** , which have **different prices** :

- **ï‚·ï‚·**** FuzzyDrink **â€“ with constant value for** FuzzyDrinkPrice - 2.50**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Juice **â€“ with constant value for** JuicePrice - 1.80**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Water **â€“ with constant value for** WaterPrice - 1.50**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Alcohol **â€“ with constant value for** AlcoholPrice - 3.50**

### Table

The **Table** is a base **class** for different types of tables and **should not be able to be instantiated**.

#### Data

- **ï‚·ï‚·**** FoodOrders ****â€“**  **collection of foods**  **accessible only by the**  **base class****.**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** DrinkOrders ****â€“**  **collection of drinks**  **accessible only by the**  **base class****.**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** TableNumber **â€“** int** the table number
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Capacity **â€“** int**the table capacity(capacity can&#39;t be less than zero. In these cases,**throw an ArgumentException **** with message ****&quot;Capacity has to be greater than 0&quot;)**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** NumberOfPeople **â€“** int**the count of people who want a table (number of people cannot be less or equal to 0. In these cases,**throw an ArgumentException **** with message ****&quot;Cannot place zero or less people!&quot;)**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** PricePerPerson â€“ decimal** the price per person for the table
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** IsReserved â€“ bool** returns true if the table is reserved
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Price â€“** calculated property, which calculates the price for all people

#### Constructor

A **table** should take the following values upon initialization:

int tableNumber, int capacity, decimal pricePerPerson

#### Child Classes

There are several concrete types of **tables** , which have **different prices** :

- **ï‚·ï‚·**** InsideTable **â€“ with constant value for** InitialPricePerPerson - 2.50**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** OutsideTable **â€“ with constant value for** InitialPricePerPerson - 3.50**

#### Behavior

##### void Reserve(int numberOfPeople)

Reserves the table with the count of people given.

##### void OrderFood(IFood food)

Orders the provided food (think of a way to collect all the food which is ordered).

##### void OrderDrink(IDrink drink)

Orders the provided drink (think of a way to collect all the drinks which are ordered).

##### decimal GetBill()

Returns the bill for all of the ordered drinks and food.

##### void Clear()

Removes all of the ordered drinks and food and finally frees the table and sets the count of people to 0.

##### string GetFreeTableInfo()

Return a string with the following format:

&quot;Table: {table number}&quot;

&quot;Type: {table type}&quot;

&quot;Capacity: {table capacity}&quot;

&quot;Price per Person: {price per person for the current table}&quot;

##### string GetOccupiedTableInfo()

Return a string with the following format:

&quot;Table: {table number}&quot;

&quot;Type: {table type}&quot;

&quot;Number of people: {table number of people}&quot;

If there aren&#39;t any food orders append the following message to the text above:

&quot;Food orders: None&quot;

If there are food orders:

&quot;Food orders: {food orders count}&quot;

Finally append each food ToString() method

The same logic you can use for the ordered drinks. If there aren&#39;t any drink orders just append the message:

&quot;Drink orders: None&quot;

But in the other case:

&quot;Drink orders: {drink orders count}&quot;

Finally append each drink ToString() method. If you got confused just look in the input output examples and you will understand it ðŸ˜Š

# Task 2: Business Logic (150 points)

### The Controller Class

The business logic of the program should be concentrated around several **commands**. Implement a class called **RestaurantController** , which will hold the **main functionality**.

**Note: The**  **RestaurantController**  **class SHOULD NOT handle exceptions! The tests are designed to expect exceptions, not messages!**

The main functionality is represented by these **public**** methods**:

| RestaurantController.cs |
| --- |
| publicstring AddFood(string type, string name, decimal price){    thrownew NotImplementedException();} publicstring AddDrink(string type, string name, int servingSize, string brand){    thrownew NotImplementedException();} publicstring AddTable(string type, int tableNumber, int capacity){    thrownew NotImplementedException();} publicstring ReserveTable(int numberOfPeople){    thrownew NotImplementedException();} publicstring OrderFood(int tableNumber, string foodName){    thrownew NotImplementedException();} publicstring OrderDrink(int tableNumber, string drinkName, string drinkBrand){    thrownew NotImplementedException();} publicstring LeaveTable(int tableNumber){    thrownew NotImplementedException();} publicstring GetFreeTablesInfo(){    thrownew NotImplementedException();} publicstring GetOccupiedTablesInfo(){    thrownew NotImplementedException();} publicstring GetSummary(){    thrownew NotImplementedException();} |

Also, the controller holds all **foods** , **drinks** and **tables** :

- **menu** â€“ List of foods â€“ ** ** foods offered by the restaurant
- **drinks** â€“ List of drinks â€“ the drinks the restaurant offers
- **tables** â€“ List of tables â€“ all tables in the restaurant

**NOTE: The**  **RestaurantController**  **class should not handle any exceptions. That should be the responsibility of the class, which reads the commands and passes them to the**  **RestaurantController****.**

### Commands

There are several commands, which control the business logic of the application. They are stated below.

#### AddFood Command

##### Parameters

- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Type **â€“** string**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Name **â€“  ** string**
- **ï‚·ï‚·**** Price **â€“** decimal**
